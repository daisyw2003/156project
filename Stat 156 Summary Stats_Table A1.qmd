We replicate Table A (Mean Characteristics of Cities In and Out of Sample) from the paper.

While our table isn't exactly identical to Table A from the paper, but the values- both means and p-values are very similar (at least to the 1st decimal place).

The covariate means, overall look very balanced between the sampled and out-of-sample observations. For the few variables (percent black-1940 and Concentration indexâ€“1990) where the p-value is significant (at 5% level), the overall difference in means in our table are close to 0 (difference in mean of 0.1 for the concentration index, and -0.018 for percentage black 1940). Thus, overall, it seems that the observations/cities are pretty well-balanced between sample and not-in-sample observations.
